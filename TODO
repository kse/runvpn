############## TODO ##############

* Init-scripts so we can start/stop our vpn's with the computer.

* Implementation of state file.

* Location based vpn setup booting.

* Only print colours if the terminal can handle it.

* Update the damned readme file!

* Fix it so you can have folders that are similar when searching case insensitive

* Check if the user is a member of the group 'runvpn'

* Clear our data structures upon exit. Just for good measure.
